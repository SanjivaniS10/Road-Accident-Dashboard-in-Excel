🧹 Data Cleaning & Transformation

The data preparation phase focused on ensuring accuracy and consistency:

Checked and handled NULL values, blanks, and errors

Removed duplicate and irrelevant columns

Ensured consistency in data types and formats

Created two new attributes:

Year

Month

These additions enabled better time-based analysis and visualization.



📈 Data Analysis

A dedicated “Data Analysis” sheet was created to summarize insights and simplify understanding for users, developers, or clients.

9 Pivot Tables were created to analyze:

Casualties by severity

Vehicle type

Road type

Location and area

Monthly trends for 2021 and 2022

Helped uncover patterns and relationships between accidents and multiple influencing factors



📊 Data Visualization

The final dashboard was created using customized Pivot Charts with a focus on clarity and interactivity.

Key Features:

Interactive Slicers and Timelines

Linked charts and icons for seamless navigation

User-friendly and visually intuitive layout
